# MATLAB Projects
A couple of interesting MATLAB projects that I've done back when I was studying at Rice University.
## Bridge project
This project creates a bridge with a given number of segments (input `nos`) and simulates the optimal cross-sectional area for the minimum work done due a specific load (input `W`).
## Decoder project
This project decodes encoded messages using the Metropolis Algorithm.
### Instructions
* In order to compile the files, you'll need MATLAB.
* If you don't have it, there are pdfs of the scripts in the repository that can be used almost one-to-one in Scilab. You can also use [mfile2sci](https://help.scilab.org/docs/2024.0.0/en_US/mfile2sci.html) to convert the .m files to Scilab.
* For the Decoder project, there are some encripted texts as an example to see how the program works but other encrypted texts should work as well.
